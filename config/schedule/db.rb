# Use this file to easily define all of your cron jobs.

# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
# set :output, "/path/to/my/cron_log.log"
#
set :output, "/home/deploy/sites/rails-bestpractices.com/production/shared/log/cron_log.log"
job_type :rake, "cd :path && RAILS_ENV=:environment bundle exec rake :task :output"

every 1.day, :at => '1am' do
  command "backup perform -t railsbp"
end

every 1.day, :at => '3am' do
  rake "job_share:rubyonjobs"
end
